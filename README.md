# QA-Interact

QA Interact is a simple React.js website to accept emails to a mailing list. This project includes an even simpler Express (Node.js) backend to handle email submission to MailChimp.

This project was made as a favor for a friend.

# What I Learned

* How to utilize Heroku to simultaneously deploy a frontend and backend
* How to use the MailChimp API to add emails to a mailing list
* Better usage of CSS to control the display dynamically
